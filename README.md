# The Azure Bakery series

Welcome to "The Azure Bakery". I’ll show you how to bake your delicious Azure cake in this series.

The series aims to approach Azure in an easy-to-understand and fun way. The goal is to engineer and deploy solutions in
the best way possible. At the same time, we’re trying to keep it simple.

The repository is part of [The Azure Bakery series](https://go.robino.io/the-azure-bakery-series-introduction/ "The Azure Bakery series") blog
posts.
